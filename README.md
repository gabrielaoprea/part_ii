Part II project 2022 - Divergence of excited state Moller-Plesset series

This repository contains code that is able to calculate the perturbation series for a given molecule  in a specific state (ground or excited state) up to an arbitrary order, with or without a level shift. Example code for MOM and Delta-SCF reference states is given. The approximants can be used to locate exceptional points and estimate the energy from the pertrubation series.

All the data gathered is included for the molecules H2, HF and H20 and the Be atom - perturbation series, roots and values of quadratic approximants, molecular orbital energies for MO diagrams.
